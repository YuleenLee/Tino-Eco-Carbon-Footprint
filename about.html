  <h1>What is the Carbon Footprint Competition?</h1>
  <p> The Carbon Footprint Competition is held by Tino Eco aimed to spread awareness on climate change and instill habits to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. It is targeted towards teens near Cupertino; however, people of all ages in the U.S. are open to join (you will only be receiving gift cards if you are not able to physically receive the prizes). We have a variety of tasks that participants can complete to earn points for prizes.
</p>
  <h1>How it came to be</h1>
  <p>Tino Eco aims to spread awareness on environmental issues and promote climate education. Therefore, we proposed the Carbon Footprint Competition to SVCE, a competition with a variety of tasks to inform participants about greenhouse gas emissions. Upon completion of a task, participants will earn points for prizes. By holding an interactive competition, we hope to motivate more people to gain awareness about climate change.
Small Competitions:
Use your creativity to spread awareness about carbon footprint as well as a chance to earn $100. Prizes (more awards, better prizes) may change due to participation and quality of work.
